# Syllabus

## Coding 1: Data Management and Analysis with R

- Instructor: Kaufmann Marc; Email: KaufmannM@ceu.edu
- Credits: 2 CEU (4 ECTS) 
- Term: Winder 2022-2023
- Course level:  MA/MSc
- Prerequisites: None

## Course description

The course serves as an introduction to the R programming language and software environment for data exploration, data munging, data analysis, and data visualization. 

### Learning outcomes

- Produce meaningful descriptive statistics and informative graphs
- Become familiar with the R ecosystem 
- Learn how to get help, how to debug, how to do basic programming
- Learn how to use R for the most common data tasks: loading, cleaning, transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data
- Learn basics of source control with `git`

### Reading list

Class materials are hosted on https://github.com/MarcKaufmann/R-Coding. Look there for an up-to-date syllabus.

### Assessment 

- Graded exercises (40 points)
- Data project of your own choice (70 points)

This sums to 110 points, yet your final score will be truncated at 100 (which will count as 100%): if you have a final score of 110, I will treat it as a score of 100 and grade based on that. Thus you have 10 points to lose without it affecting your grade. 

There will be no final exam. 

Minimum passing grade is 51%. Every increase in 7% leads to a higher grade: 51 to 57 yields a C; 58 to 64 yields a C+; 65 to 71 yields a B-; 72 to 78 yields a B; 79 to 85 yields a B+, 86 to 92 yields an A-; 93 to 100 yields an A.

If you have a question regarding a particular assignment -- whether about the grade or otherwise -- make sure to email me.

### Technical/laptop requirement

You will need your laptop with RStudio, R, and git installed in order to participate in class.

### Tentative Course schedule 

**Note:** This is subject to reording and minor changes, but the broad set of topics should remain fairly stable.

1. git; R ecosystem, basic syntax, R Markdown; how to get help; first plot
1. ggplot2: data visualization; introduction to functions
1. Tidyverse: choosing data with `filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`
1. Tidyverse: transforming data with `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `group_by()`
1. Tidyverse: more transformations with `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `filter()`
1. Tidyverse: reading data with `read_csv()` and `parse_*()`
1. Tidyverse: tidying data with `spread()` and `gather()`; basic hypotheses testing
1. Tidyverse: `left_join()` and `join()`; basic regressions
1. Functions, loops, and friends; sampling, simulating, bootstrapping (GD)
1. working with data the non-tidyverse way; lubridate for working with dates
1. Basic Spatial Data
1. All the rest

### Short bio of the instructor (1 para)

Marc Kaufmann teaches how to think with economic models, and how to use them to ask the right questions. He studied at Cambridge, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Berkeley, and Harvard.
